# [ImprovedHoes](https://sites.google.com/site/furglsmods/improved-hoes)
Improved Hoes makes farming with hoes much quicker and easier. Each type of hoe has a specific range of blocks that it can work with. Within this range, the hoe can till land, harvest crops, or harvest and replant crops. Shifting while using the hoe will operate the hoe normally. Other Vanilla-like hoes from mods can have the same effects when added in the config.
